This app was lifted from the Python Language Projects book by Laura Casell and Alan Gauld.

Please see Chapter 5 in the book for more information on how the code works.

The app employs flask with a simple sqlite db. I thought this would make the best example
to learn how to dockerize applications.

The devops-project in my repo will also utilize this app to demonstrate basic ci/cd workflows
when I add/modify the codebase.
